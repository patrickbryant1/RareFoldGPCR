#RareFoldGPCR
Structure Prediction and **Design of GPCR Agonists** with Noncanonical Amino Acids

By transfer learning from [RareFold](https://github.com/patrickbryant1/RareFold) on
high-quality structurtes from [GPCRdb](https://gpcrdb.org/), we can learn how to incorporate
noncanonical amino acids (NCAAs) seen in RareFold to the structure prediction of GPCRs without ever having
seen NCAA-based GPCR modulators.

RareFoldGPCR (RFG) supports 49 different amino acid types.\
The 20 regular ones, and 29 **rare** ones:
MSE, TPO, MLY, CME, PTR, SEP,SAH, CSO, PCA, KCX, CAS, CSD, MLZ, OCS, ALY, CSS, CSX, HIC, HYP, YCM, YOF, M3L, PFF, CGU,FTR, LLP, CAF, CMH, MHO
